\subsection{Group Action}
\noindent
A group G acts on a set S:

$G \times S \to S$

$(g, s) \mapsto g \cdot s$

$e \cdot s = s$

$(g g') \cdot s = g \cdot (g' \cdot s)$

\noindent
Alternatively,

$\phi: G \to Perm(S)$

$\phi$ is a homomorphism (gives the corresponding properties)

$(\phi(g))(s) = g \cdot s$

\subsection{Examples of Group Actions}

\noindent
The trivial action:

$G \to Perm(S)$ where $g \mapsto e_{Perm(S)}$

\noindent
G acting on self by left/right translation, conjugation

\noindent
G acting on the set of subgroups of G by conjugation:

$g \cdot H = gHg^{-1} = \{ghg^{-1} | h \in H\}$

\noindent
Normal subgroup $N \trianglelefteq G$

G acting on N, $g \cdot n := gng^{-1} \in N$

\noindent
$G = S_3$ where S is the set of subgroups of G of order 2.

S = \{\{1, (1 2)\}, \{1, (1 3)\}, \{1, (2 3)\}\}

\noindent recall
$\sigma (a_1, a_2, a_3, ... a_k) \sigma^{-1} = (\sigma a_1, \sigma a_2, \sigma a_3, ... \sigma a_k)$

\noindent
V vector space over a field K

G = GL(V) = group of invertible linear maps $V \to V$

e.g. if $V = K^n$ then G = GL(n, K)

G acts on V (rather simply) by $L \cdot v = L(v)$

\subsection{Orbits and Stabilizers}

\noindent
Given G acting on S by $G \times S \to S$ there is an obvious relation on S:

s, s': $s \thicksim s' \leftrightarrow \exists g \in G, s' = gs $

the orbit of s is just the equivalence class of s under this relation

i.e., $G \cdot s = \{g \cdot s | g \in G\}$

\noindent
The conjugacy classes of s are the orbits of S under the group action of G by conjugation

the orbit of s, $O(s) = \{s\} \leftrightarrow s = gsg^{-1} \forall g$

$\leftrightarrow (\forall g)gs = sg$

$\leftrightarrow s \in Z(G)$ the center of the group

\noindent
Example, for $G = S_3$

the orbit of 1 is \{1\}

the orbit of (1 2) = \{(1 2), (1 3), (2 3)\}

the orbit of (1 2 3) = \{(1 2 3), (1 3 2)\}

\noindent
Stabilizer (isotropy group) of a given element $s \in S := G_s$

$G_s = \{g \in G |g \cdot s = s\}$

stabilizer is closed under inverses: $g \in G_s \to g \cdot s = s \to g^{-1}gs = g^{-1}s \to s = g^{-1}s$

\subsection{large stabilizer$\leftrightarrow$ small orbit}

\noindent
there exists a natural bijection $\alpha: G/G_s \to O(s)$ defined $gG_s \mapsto g \cdot s$


\noindent
well-definition:

if $g_1G_s = g_2G_s$
then $\exists g \in G_s, g_1 = g_2g$
and $\alpha(g_1G_s) = g_1 \cdot s = g_2 g s = g_2 s = \alpha(g_2G_s)$

\noindent
injectivity:

if $\alpha(g_1G_s) = g_1 \cdot s = g_2 \cdot s = \alpha(g_2G_s)$
then $g_2^{-1}g_1 \cdot s = s$, $g_2^{-1}g_1 \in G_s$ and $g_1G_s = g_2G_s$


\section{9/1}

\subsection{Group Actions $\to$ Sylow theorems}

Recall:

the stabilizer $G_s = \{g \in G | g \cdot s = s\}$

the orbit $O(s) = \{g \cdot s | g \in G\}$

$G\slash G_s \cong O(s)$ and $\#(G\slash G_s) = \#O(s)$

\noindent
Let $\Sigma =$ set of representatives for $s \sim s' \leftrightarrow O(s) = O(s')$

$\#S = \sum_{s \in \Sigma}\#O(s) = \sum_s(G:G_s)$

G finite $(G:G_s) = \frac{\#G}{\#G_s}$

Mass formula $\#S = (\sum_s\frac{1}{\#(G_s)})(\#G)$

\noindent
A subgroup H of G acted upon by G has orbits, cosets, and trivial stabilizer.

Hence from the above $\#H_s = \#H$, and $\#G = (G:H) \cdot \#H$.

This is a statement of Lagrange's Theorem, $(G:H) = \frac{\#G}{\#H}$.

\noindent
The kernel of the action $$K = \bigcap_{s \in S}G_s$$

This is just the kernel of $G \xrightarrow{\phi} Perm(S)$.

\noindent
We can relate the stabilizers of points in the same orbit.

Let $s' = gs$.

Assume $x \in G_s$.  

Since $x \in G_s$, $(gxg^{-1})gs = g(xs) = gs$.

Hence $gxg^{-1} \in G_{gs}$, so $gG_sg^{-1} \subset G_{gs}$.

Apply this relation with $g \to g^{-1}$ and $s \to gs$:

Assume $x \in G_{gs}$.

Then $(g\inv xg)(s) = (g\inv)(xgs) = (g\inv gs) = s$.

So $g\inv G_{gs}g \subset G_s \to G_{gs} \subset gG_sg\inv$

\noindent
Thus, $gG_sg\inv = G_{gs} = G_{s'}$.

The stabilizer of $s'=gs$ is a conjugate of the stabilizer of $s$.

\subsection{Applications}

p : prime

\noindent
p-group: a finite group G, $\#G = p^n, n \geq 1$\\

\noindent
``A p-group has a non-trivial center''

Recall: the center $Z(G) = Z = \{g \in G | gs = sg \forall s\in G\}$.

Since $gs = sg \to s = gsg^{-1}$, will be useful to consider action on self by conjugation.

\noindent
G a p-group, S a finite set.  Then $\#O(s) = \frac{\#G}{\#G_s} = \frac{p^n}{p^k}$.

\noindent
Two cases:

1) $\#O(s) = 1$, s is fixed by G, $s \in S^G$ (set of fixed points of S)

2) ($k < n$), thus $\#O(s)$ is divisible by p.

\noindent
$\#S =$ sum of \# of elements in the orbits $\equiv_{mod p} \#$ of orbits of size 1 $= \#(S^G)$.

Take S = G, with action $g: s \mapsto gsg^{-1}$.  Then $S^G = Z(G)$.

$\#Z(G) \equiv_{mod p} \#(S^G) \equiv_{mod p} \#S = \#G = p^n \equiv_{mod p} 0$.

Thus, the order of the center is divisible by p, and must be non-trivial.\\

\noindent
$H \leq G$ a finite group, $(G : H) = p$, the smallest prime dividing \#G $\to H \trianglelefteq G$

Let $S = G\slash H$; $\#(S) = (G : H) = p$, and let G act on S by left translation.

This induces $\varphi: G \to S_P$; recall $\#S_p = p!$

The stabillizer of H, $G_H = \{x \in G | xH = H\} = H$.

By inspection, we can see that $G_{gH} = gHg^{-1}$.

Let $K = \bigcap_{g \in G}gHg^{-1}$, the largest normal subgroup contained in H.

Note that $K = ker(\varphi)$ induced above; by the First Isomorphism Theorem $\varphi(G) \leq S_p$.

$(G : K) = \#(G\slash K) = \#(\varphi(G))$, which divides $\#(S_p) = p!$

Further, since $K \leq H \leq G$, $(G : K) = (G : H)(H : K)$.

Since $(G : K)$ divides $p!$ and $(G : H)$ divides p, $(H : K)$ divides $(p - 1)!$.

But p is the smallest prime dividing $\#G$, so $(H : K)$ = 1, $K = H$ and H is normal.\\

\noindent
A familiar embedding of a group into a larger group; ``Cauchy's Theorem''

$G \hookrightarrow Perm(G)$ by letting G act on itself by left-translation.

Its kernel $K = \{g \in G | gs=s \forall s\} = \{e\}$ (consider $s = e$), hence is an injection.

Since an injection, an embedding.

\noindent
Recall $S_n \subset$ group of $n \times n$ invertible matrices. $\sigma \mapsto M(\sigma)$ a permutation matrix.

Need to be careful in the construction to ensure $M(\sigma\tau)=M(\sigma)M(\tau)$!

E.g. $\sigma = (1 3 2)$ does $M(\sigma)$ have 1 in the 1st column, 3rd row?

Or in the 1st row, 3rd column?  One of these yields $M(\sigma\tau) = M(\tau)M(\sigma)$.

\noindent
G finite of order n; V the vector space of functions $G \xrightarrow{f} \mathds{Z}$; note $V \cong \mathds{Z}^n$

Linear maps $V \to V$ correspond to $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathds{Z}$:  $GL(V) \approx GL(n, \mathds{Z})$.

Similarly, invertible linear maps correspond to $n \times n$ invertible matrices over $\mathds{Z}$.

We can embed G in $GL(n, \mathds{Z})$ by using a left action of G on $GL(n, \mathds{Z}) = \{\phi: V \to V\}$

Recall that $V = \{f : G \to \mathds{Z}\}$.

This left action takes the form $L_g \mapsto \phi$ where $\phi(f(x)) = f(xg)$

$L_{gg'} = L_{g'} \circ L_{g}$ as desired? Verify for yourself.

\textbf{Check this over.}

$L_{gg'}(\varphi (x)) = \varphi(xgg') = L_{g'}(\varphi (xg)) = L_{g'} \circ L_g (\varphi(x))$

$g \mapsto L_g$ is a homomorphism $G \to GL(V)$

Using $\mathds{F}_p$ instead of $\mathds{Z}$, get $G \hookrightarrow GL(n, \mathds{F}_p)$, an embedding into a finite group.

\section{9/3}

\subsection{Sylow Theorems}

Lagrange: If $H \leq G$ then $\#(H)|\#(G)$.

$A_4$ with $n = 6$ gives the counterexample to the converse.

\noindent
Salvaging the converse: the case where $n = p^k$, p prime.

\noindent
(Sylow I): If $|G| = p^k \cdot r$, $(p, r) = 1$

$\exists H \leq G$ such that $|H| = p^k$

Such an H is called a p-Sylow subgroup of G

Generally assuming $k \neq 0$

\noindent
Example : $\mathds{Z}_{12}$

has 2-sylow subgroup $\{0, 3, 6, 9\}$ and 3-sylow subgroup $\{0, 4, 8\}$

\noindent
Example: $D_6$ generated by r, s subject to $rs = sr^{-1}$, $r^6 = e$, $s^2 = e$, has order 12

$\#(D_6) = 12$ so has 3-sylow subgroup $\{1, r^2, r^4\}$

Also has 2-sylow subgroups $\{1, r^3, s, r^3s\}$, $\{1, r^3, rs, r^4s\}$, $\{1, r^3, r^2s, r^5s\}$

\noindent
Example: G = $GL_n(\mathds{F}_p)$, $n \times n$ linear transformations in $\mathds{F}_p$, equal to $Aut(\mathds{F}_p^n)$

\noindent
The order of $|G|$:  

Asserting linear independence in each vector of an $n \times n$ matrix

$|G| = (p^n - 1)(p^n-p)(p^n-p^2)\cdots(p^n-p^{n-1}) = p^{1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n - 1}\cdot r = p^{\frac{n^2 - n}{2}} \cdot r$

$(p, r) = 1$

Consider P the set of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal.

Then $|P| = p^{1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n - 1} = p^{\frac{n^2 - n}{2}}$, and P is a p-Sylow subgroup.

\noindent
Theorem: (Sylow I) p-Sylow subgroups always exist.

\noindent
Proof Sketch:

Suppose $|H| = p^k \cdot r$, $(p, r) = 1$, $k > 0$

Show $\exists G$, $H \leq G$, where G has a p-Sylow subgroup

Show that if G has a p-Sylow subgroup and $H \leq G$, then H has a p-Sylow subgroup

\noindent
Proof:

By Cayley's theorem, if $|H| = n$, then $H \leq S_n$.

(H acts on itself by left translates.  This yields an embedding into $S_n$.)

Additionally $S_n \leq GL_n(\mathds{F}_p)$ mapping to permutation matrices.

Alternatively, consider $V \cong \mathds{F}_p^n$, the vector space of functions $\varphi : G \to \mathds{F}_p$.

Embed H into $GL(V)$ by this action: $g \in H \mapsto$ automorphism taking $\varphi(x)$ to $\varphi(xg)$.

(Recall end of previous lecture).

We know that $GL_n(\mathds{F}_p)$ has p-Sylow subgroups.  (from the lower triangular matrices)

Let $G = GL_n(\mathds{F}_p)$.

Let P be a p-Sylow subgroup of G.  Consider G acting on the set of cosets of P.

Now, $Stab(gP) = gPg^{-1}$. (guest lecturer notation for stabilizer)

Similarly, letting H act on $G \slash P$, $Stab(gP) = (gPg^{-1} \cap H)$

This intersection is a p-group.

Want to choose $g \in G$ such that $gPg^{-1} \cap H$ is a p-Sylow subgroup.

If $(H : (gPg^{-1} \cap H))$ is coprime to p, then $gPg^{-1} \cap H$ is a p-Sylow subgroup.

By Orbit-Stabilizer, $(H : (gPg^{-1} \cap H)) = O(gP)$.

Note this is an orbit of $G/P$ induced by the action of the group H.

Since P is a p-Sylow subgroup of G, $|G\slash P| \not\equiv_{mod p} 0$.

The sum of the orbits is $|G \slash P|$.

Hence there must be some orbit with size coprime to p.\\

\noindent
Corollary: All p-subgroups of H are contained in a conjugate of P.

Let $J \leq H$ be a p-subgroup.  Then $J \cap gPg\inv$ is a p-Sylow subgroup of $J$ for some $g \in G$.

So since $J$ is a p-group $J \cap gPg\inv = J$, i.e. $J \subset gPg\inv$.

(since a p-group can't contain a proper p-Sylow subgroup by definition)\\

\noindent
Corollary: (Sylow II) All p-Sylow groups are conjugate.

\noindent
Proof:

Let $H \leq G$ and $P \leq G$ be p-Sylow subgroups.

By the preceding corollary, $H \subset gPg\inv$ for some $g \in G$.

Since $|H| = |P| = |gPg^{-1}|$, $H \cap gPg\inv = H$.\\

\noindent
Corollary: Every p-subgroup of G is contained in a p-Sylow of G.

By the above, each is contained in a conjugate of P, said conjugate being a p-Sylow.\\

\noindent
The p-Sylow subgroups in G are all conjugate, so that:

If P is a p-Sylow of G then $G/N(P)$ is the set of p-Sylows in G.

Where $N(P)$ is the normalizer of P.

So there are $(G: N(P))$ p-Sylows in total.\\

\noindent
Lemma: If a finite p-group $\Gamma$ acts on a set X, then $\#(X) \equiv_{mod p} \#(X^{\Gamma})$

($X^{\Gamma}$ the fixed points of X under $\Gamma$).

\noindent
Proof:

$\#X = \sum_i \#Orb(x_i) = \sum_i \frac{|\Gamma|}{|Stab(x_i)|} \equiv_{mod p} \#X^{\Gamma}$

Each $\frac{|\Gamma|}{|Stab(x_i)|} \equiv_{mod p} 1$ if $x_i$ fixed, else $\frac{|\Gamma|}{|Stab(x_i)|} \equiv_{mod p} 0$.\\

\noindent
Let $Syl_p(G)$ describe the p-Sylow subgroups of G and $n_p$ denote its cardinality.

\noindent
Theorem: (Sylow III) If $|G|= p^k \cdot r$, $k > 0$ then $n_p \equiv_{mod p} 1$.  Further, $n_p | r$.

\noindent
Proof:

Let P act on $Syl_p(G)$ by conjugation.

By the lemma, $\#Syl_p(G) = n_p \equiv_{mod p} (Syl_p(G))^P$.

Suppose Q is fixed under the group action.  Then $pQp\inv = Q$ $\forall p \in P$.

Then $P \leq N(Q)$; similarly $Q \leq N(Q)$.

P, Q are p-Sylow subgroups of N(Q); therefore P, Q are conjugate in N(Q).

However, $Q \trianglelefteq N(Q)$ so that Q is equal to all its conjugates in N(Q), and $P = Q$.

Hence P is the only fixed Sylow-p subgroup so $(Syl_P(G))^P \equiv_{mod p} 1$.

G acts on $Syl_p(G)$ as only one orbit since all p-Sylows in G are conjugate.

$(G : P) = n_p$, $n_p = |G| = p^k \cdot r$, $n_p | p^k \cdot r$, but $n_p \nmid p$, so $n_p | r$.

\section{9/8}

\subsection{Review of Sylow Theorems}

Prove existence by showing existence in a larger known subgroup.

And then that contained subgroups must have their own Sylow p-subgroups.

$O(s) = S = \{$p-Sylows$\}$

$O(s) = G\slash G_s = G \slash N(P)$

The number of p-Sylows is notated $n_p = (G : N(P))$

\noindent
$P, Q$ p-Sylows and $P \subset N(Q)$ then $P = Q$

reason: $PQ \leq G$ a subgroup of G

$HK$ not necessarily a group, but will be if one normalizes the other

ie $H \subset N(K)$

\noindent
Theorem $n_p \equiv_{mod p} 1$

Consider the action of $P$ on $S$ by conjugation

Take $x \in P$ and $x: Q \mapsto xQx\inv$

The number of fixed points is 1, since $P$ fixes only itself

\noindent
A simple group has

more than one element

no non-trivial proper normal subgroups

(kind of like a prime number)

\noindent
G finite abelian

G simple $\leftrightarrow$ G cyclic of prime order (simple easy exercise)

\subsection{continuing...}

\noindent
non-sporadic finite simple groups

$A_n (n \leq 5)$

recall the alternating groups $A_n$ are the even permutations on $\{1, \cdots, n\}$

Lie groups over finite fields, e.g. $\{\pm \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}\} \subset SL(2, \mathds{Z}|p\mathds{Z})$

P = projective; $PSL(2, \mathds{Z}|p\mathds{Z}) = SL(2, \mathds{Z}|p\mathds{Z})$

\noindent
Simple groups of order $\leq 60$.

(a) There are no non-abelian simple groups of order $< 60$

(b) If G is simple of order 60, then $G \cong A_5$.

($\#A_n = \frac{n!}{2}$)

\noindent
G simple of order 60.

$H < G$ simple (finite), H proper, $(G: H) = n \geq 2$

G acts on $G\slash H$ by left translation.

The action is transitive (for each pair $xH, yH$, $\exists$ permutation taking one to the other)

Therefore, this action is non-trivial.

$\pi : G \to Perm(G\slash H) = S_n$

$ker(\pi) \neq G$ and is a normal subgroup $\to$ the kernel is trivial.

$\pi: G \hookrightarrow S_n$ and in fact $\pi: G \hookrightarrow A_n$ (if $\#G > 2$)

\noindent
Why? because $G \cap A_n \trianglelefteq G$

If $G \subset S_n$.

Then $G \to S_n/A_n = \{\pm 1\}$ by the sign map, kernel is $G \cap A_n$.

Recall $sgn: S_n \to \{\pm 1\}$ $sgn(\sigma) = (-1)^t$ given t, num of transpositions

$G/(G \cap A_n) \hookrightarrow S_n/A_n = \{\pm 1\}$

$(G : G \cap A_n) = 1$ or $2$.

If G is simple then this cannot be 2 (would be normal subgroup), so =1.

And $G \hookrightarrow A_n$ for that $A_n$.

\noindent
G simple, order 60.

H a proper subgroup of G, index n.  (consider small values of n)

If $n = 2$ then H is normal in G, a contradiction.

(smallest prime dividing the order of a group)

If $n = 3$ or $n = 4$: $G \hookrightarrow A_3, A_4$ but their orders are too small (3, 12)

If $n = 5$: $G \hookrightarrow A_5$ and they are equal in cardinality $\to$ done.

Remaining case: $n = 15$.

What is $n_5$, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups.

$n_5 | 60\slash 5 = 12$, $n_5 = (G : N(P))$ $n_5$ divides the index

Also, $n_5 \equiv_{mod 5} 1$.

Thus $n_5 = 1$ or $n_5 = 6$.

If $n_5 = 1$ then only one 5-Sylow subgroup of G, must be normal.

This is impossible since G is simple.

Then $n_5 = 6$: tells you there are lots of elements of order 5 in G.

There is no overlap (excepting at the identity) between 5-Sylows.

Hence the number of elements of order 5 is $6 \cdot 4 = 24$

Elements of order 5 in $A_5$ are 5-cycles (a b c d e).

Need to take all strings of length 5: 120, and divide out by rotations 5.

Thus we get $120 \slash 5 = 24$ (check).

Consider $n_2$ the number of 2-Sylow subgroups.

Then $n_2$ divides $60/4 = 15$, and $n_2 \neq 1$ because of simplicity.

Also, $n_2 = (G : N(P_2))$, and this can't be 3 since G has no subgroup of index 3.

If $n_2 = 5$ then $N(P_2)$ is the desired index-5 subgroup $\to$ done.

From divisibility $n_2 = 1, 3, 5, 15$.

Elminate 1 by simplicity, 3 since the index is too small, 5 works, consider 15.

\noindent
Considering the situation where there are 15 2-Sylow subgroups (of order 4).

These are groups like the Klein 4-group (no elements of order 4).

There are 2 2-Sylow subgroups P and Q where $P \cap Q$ has order 2.

Prove by counting.

Taking intersection, must be proper else they would be the same.

Hence $P \cap Q$ has order 1 or 2.

If there is utterly no overlap, there are $15 \cdot 3 + 1 = 46$ elt's of 2-Sylows.

And these do not have order 5.  But there are 24 elements of order 5.  Too many.

\noindent
Now we know that some of these 2-Sylow subgroups have non-trivial overlap.

Consider $N(P \cap Q)$ for some such intersection, will be a subgroup of G.

Cannot be all of G, G is simple. (would make $P \cap Q$ normal)

$N(P \cap Q)$ contains P and Q since both are abelian.

Each are normal subgroups of $N(P \cap Q)$, so its order is divisible by 4.

Hence could have order 12, 20, or 60 (divisible by 4, divides 60).

Its index cannot be 1 (G is simple) cannot be 3 ($A_n$ too small), = 5.

G finite non-trivial.  Is G simple?  $\{e\} \subset G$, $G/\{e\}$ simple.

Proposition: $\exists G = G_0 \supset G_1 \supset G_2 \supset \cdots \supset G_n$, $G_{i + 1} \trianglelefteq G_i$, $G_i/G_{i+1}$ simple.

Main point.

Theorem of ``Camille Jordan and some guy named H\"{o}lder.''

\section{9/10}

\subsection{Jordan-H\"{o}lder Theorem.}

$G = G_0 \supset G_1 \supset G_2 \supset \cdots \supset G_n$

$G_{i + 1} \trianglelefteq G_i$, $G_i/G_{i + 1} = Q_i$ simple.

\noindent
Statement of the theorem:

The ``set'' (multiplicity matters) $\{Q_0, \cdots, Q_{n - 1}\}$ is independent of the filtration.

Order doesn't count, $Q_i$ up to isomorphism.

\noindent
Proof strategy: by induction.

If G has a filtration with n quotients, then all filtrations have n quotients.

And all filters have the same set of quotients.

\noindent
Question, can two different groups have the same reduction?

Answer: yes.  $S_3 \supset A_3 \supset \{e\}.$ Quotients $\mathds{Z}/2\mathds{Z}$ and $\mathds{Z}/3\mathds{Z}$.

Also $\mathds{Z}/6\mathds{Z} \supset 3\mathds{Z}/6\mathds{Z} \supset 6\mathds{Z}/6\mathds{Z}$, same quotients but radically different structure.

``Knowing the building blocks does not confer knowledge of the building''.

\noindent
Demonstrating the existence of such a filtration for a group $G \neq \{e\}$.

Similar to the proof of prime decompositions.

If it is simple, then the filtration is $G \supset \{e\}$, done.

If G is not simple, $G \supset N \supset \{e\}$, and $G/N, N$ smaller than G.

Strong induction.  $\overline{G} = G/N$, then $\overline{G} \supset \overline{G_1} \supset \cdots$ and similarly for $N \supset H_1 \supset \cdots$

Note there is a correspondence b/t subgroups of G con't N and subgroups of $G/N$

$G \supset L \supset N$, $L/N \subset G/N$ and $\pi: G \to G/N$, $\pi^{-1}(K) \subset G$ and $K \subset G/N$.

\noindent
Base case $n = 1$, $G \supset \{e\}$, $G/\{e\}$ simple and G simple.

\noindent
Supposing $G \supset G_1 \supset \cdots \supset G_n \supset \{e\} = G_{n + 1}$ and $G \supset G_1' \supset \cdots \supset G_m' \supset \{e\} = G_{m + 1}'$.

? $m = n$, $\{G_i / G_{i + 1}\} = \{G_j'/G_{j + 1}'\}$ ... If $G_1' = G_1$, then done by induction.

Assume $G_1, G_1'$ are distinct.  Then $G_1 \cap G_1'$ is smaller than $G_1$ or $G_1'$.

Also, $G_1G_1'$ is a subgroup since its factors are normal by hypothesis.

Indeed, it is also a normal subgroup since $G_1$ and $G_1'$ are invariant under conjugation.

Additionally, $G_1G_1'$ is of size larger than $G_1$ and $G_1'$.  Thus it must be equal to G.

Can map $G_1'/(G_1 \cap G_1') \to G_1G_1'/G_1$.  Kernel is exactly $G_1 \cap G_1'$, hence injection.

This defines $G_1'/(G_1 \cap G_1') \hookrightarrow G/G_1$.  Symmetrically, $G_1/(G_1 \cap G_1') = G/G_1'$.

Have $G_1 \supset \cdots \supset G_n \supset \{e\} = G_{n + 1}$.

Take $G_1 \supset G_1 \cap G_1' = H \supset H_1 \supset H_2 \supset \cdots \supset H_k \supset \{e\}$, a Jordan-H\"{o}lder filtration of $G_1$.

Obtained by induction.

Note $G_1/H = G/G_1'$ is the first quotient of this filtration.

By induction, these two filtrations have the same length.

The constituents of $G_1$ are the constituents of H, with $G_1/H = G/G_1'$ appended.

Constituents: $G/G_1$ + constituents of $G_1$ = $G/G_1$ + $G/G_1'$ + constituents of H.

Have $G \supset G_1' \supset H \supset H_1 \supset \cdots \supset H_k = \{e\}$, same length as $G_1' \supset G_2' \supset \cdots \supset G_m' = \{e\}$.

Have related two different filtrations that have are unrelated, by a common filtration,

which depends on the intersection of these two filtrations.

\subsection{Free Groups}

S a set, define the free abelian group on $S$, $\mathds{Z}^S = \mathds{Z}\langle S\rangle = \{\sum_{s \in S} n_s \cdot s | n_s \in \mathds{Z}\}$.

Where all but finitely many of the $n_s$ are 0.

$S = \{1, \cdots, n\}$, $\mathds{Z}^S = \mathds{Z}^n = \{(c_1, \cdots, c_n) | c_i \in \mathds{Z}\}$

$$\sum_{i = 0}^\infty n_i x^i = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty n_i \cdot i \in \mathds{Z}\langle S \rangle$$

where $n_i = 0$ for $i >> 0$.

\noindent
``To map $\mathds{Z}\langle X\rangle$ to A in the world of abelian groups is to map S to A in the world of sets.''

$S \to \mathds{Z}\langle S \rangle$ a set map, $s \in S \mapsto 1 \cdot s$.

Given $f: \mathds{Z} \langle S \rangle A$ homomorphism.

And in fact, $F: Hom(\mathds{Z} \langle X\rangle, A) \to Maps(S, A)$, F is a bijection.

\noindent
These elements of the free abelian group are ``formal sums''.

That is, an $f: S \to \mathds{Z}$.

\noindent
Let $f: \mathds{Z}\langle S\rangle \to A$, $f(\sum n_ss) = \sum_{s \in S}n_sf(s)$

\noindent
An abelian group A is free of finite rank if $A \cong \mathds{Z}^n$ for some $n \geq 0$ ($\mathds{Z} = \mathds{Z}\langle \emptyset \rangle = 0$).

Define $rank(A) = n$.  If $\mathds{Z}^m \cong A \cong \mathds{Z}^n$ then n = m.

Why? Take positive integer $> 1$, e.g. 2.  Then $\mathds{Z}^n/2\mathds{Z}^n \cong \mathds{Z}^m/2\mathds{Z}^m$.

LHS has $2^n$ elts and RHS has $2^m$ elts so $n = m$. \\

\noindent
A subgroup of a free abelian group of rank n is a free abelian group of rank $\leq n$.

\noindent
Proof: by induction on n.

$n = 0$: $A = (0) = B$.

$n = 1$: $A = \mathds{Z} \supset B$.  What are the subgroups of $\mathds{Z}$? $(0), (t) = t\mathds{Z}, t \geq 1$.

Proof by division algorithm: $\mathds{Z} \supset B \neq 0$, $t = $smallest positive integer in B.

Division algorithm ensures that all elements are multiples of t.

$B \subset \mathds{Z}^n \xrightarrow{\pi} \mathds{Z}$.

$\pi: (c_1, \cdots, c_n) \mapsto c_n \in \mathds{Z}$.

\noindent
Cases:

(1) $\pi(B) = (0), B \subset \mathds{Z}^{n-1}$, free of rank $\leq n - 1$

(2) $\pi(B) = t\mathds{Z}, t \geq 1$

$B \xrightarrow{\pi|_B} t\mathds{Z} \xrightarrow{surj.} 0$

$ker(\pi)|_B = C$ free of rank $\leq n - 1$.

Choose $b \in B$ such that $\pi(b) = t$.

$C \subset \mathds{Z}^{n-1}: C = ker(\pi)|_B$, free of rank $\leq n - 1$.

$C = B \cap \mathds{Z}^{n - 1}$

$C \subset B$, $\mathds{Z} \cdot b \subset B$

\textbf{Missing (pf in Lang)}

\noindent
Simple linear algebra.

$a_1, \cdots, a_n \in A$ corresponds to a homomorphism $\mathds{Z}^n \to A$, $(c_1, \cdots, c_n) \mapsto \sum_{i = 1}^n c_ia_i$.

These are linearly independent if f is 1-to-1, and these span/generate A if $f$ is onto.

A is finitely generated if A is spanned by $a_1, \cdots, a_n$ for some $n \geq 0$, $a_i \in A$

A is finitely generated iff A is a quotient of $\mathds{Z}^n$ for some n.

\noindent
Corollary: a subgroup of a finitely generated abelian group is again finitely generated.

$\mathds{Z}^n \xrightarrow{f} A$ finitely generated, have $B \subset A$, $f^{-1}(B) \leq \mathds{Z}^n$, and $f^{-1}(B) \cong \mathds{Z}^k$, $k \leq n$.\\

\noindent
A finitely generated, torsion-free.

I.e. given $a \in A$ and $n \cdot a = 0$, $n \geq 1$, then $a = 0$.

Statement: A is free and of finite rank.

\noindent
Proof: Take a finite set of generators S in which take T lin indep and large as possible.

take $T = a_1, \cdots, a_k$ and $S = a_1, \cdots, a_k, \cdots, a_m$

$\sum_{1}^{k + 1} c_ka_k = 0$, $c_{k+1} \neq 0$

$B = span\{a_1, \cdots, a_k\} \cong \mathds{Z}^k$.

$a_{k + 1}, \cdots,a_m$: some multiple lies on B.

$N \geq 1$; $N \cdot A \subset B$.

Th: NA free, $N: A \to NA$ A torsion free.

Multiplication on A by a positive integer is injective.

A is isomorphic to NA by the mutliplication by n, since NA is free, A is free.
