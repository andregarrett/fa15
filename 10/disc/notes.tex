Near Eastern Studies 10 Discussion, Fall 2015

\section{9/21}

Egypt: ``wasta'' is like cred, if you have it, you can get stuff done

it's all about who you know

the connections you have are important

if you don't have a connection with somebody, might need presents

``Cairo is like Athens on acid''

\noindent
One thing about Egypt, (sim. other Arab countries) people like to make you happy

people won't tell you outright if something is not doable

learned to tell by the expression on faces something isn't really doable but doesn't want to say

also, very hospitable, but in a different fashion from what we're used to

\noindent
In Egypt, as in many other countries, considered more desirable to be paler

\noindent
Egyptian military not too competent (thought Mexican tourists were ISIS, firebombed)

but other than that, Egypt is highly safe; ``Cairo is safer than San Francisco''

\noindent
Mubarak replaced by el-Sisi; as typical, likely a transition from dictatorship to dictatorship

(Abdel Fattah) el-Sisi seems to be good at putting people in prison

\noindent
Generally, Americans will be followed to keep tabs on the safety of the American

Mostly problematic because the police escorts, on a power trip, would harass Egyptian friends\\

\noindent
Today's lecture was about the Gulf states

\section{Reel Bad Arabs}

Topic: portrayal of Arabs in film.

\noindent
Stereotypes

exceptionally rich but too stupid to know value of money

often trying to buy property in a strongarm manner

tv movie: ``the Arabs are trying to simply buy us''

obsession with the blonde, blue-eyed American woman, lecherous

\noindent
Randomly injected into movies that have nothing to do with Arabs

militaristic stereotype

\noindent
Female stereotype

Eroticized, then portrayed as a terrorist

Otherwise ``bundles in back''

\noindent
Weighing in on Israel-Palestine

Shown as violent murderers, harsh against women, vindictive

\noindent
Note: many many of these movies are quite old (70s, 80s, 90s)

True Lies: 1994

Earliest was I think Aladdin

\noindent
``We never see the suffering Palestinians in camps.''

``We humanize Israelis, but not Palestinians.''

\noindent
Rules of Engagement: 2000 (in Yemen)

portrayed some humanity in Yemeni, but then depicted as violent

\noindent
Haven't mentioned matter of proportion

Arabs existing on screen in the realm of regular human interaction in America

\noindent
Tangent about Timothy McVey bombing

media response: questions about potential Arab cause

\noindent
Hate crimes and profiling ``illustrates the power of film''

\noindent
Comedians $\to$ Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911 is good

\noindent
Other good examples

Three Kings (1999)

Kingdom of Heaven (2005): Saladdin embracing religious tolerance

Eager to embrace U.S. films showing them in an honest manner

Syriana (2005)

Hideous Kinky (1998)

Paradise Now (2005) depicts 3 Palestinians with all their qualities
